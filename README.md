# Data-Preprocessing-and-Data-Visualization
The implementation utilizes Python’s powerful data science libraries including Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Seaborn, demonstrating modern approaches to data preprocessing and exploration. Each task is designed to address specific challenges commonly encountered in real-world data analysis scenarios.


Objectives / Aim
• To implement data binning techniques for discretizing continuous variables
• To apply standardization using Z-score normalization
• To demonstrate different methods of handling categorical data
• To explore and implement missing value handling techniques
• To create informative visualizations for data analysis

Tools & Technologies Used
• Python 3.10: Primary programming language
• Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
• NumPy: Numerical computing operations
• Scikit-learn: Machine learning utilities
• Seaborn & Matplotlib: Data visualization
• Jupyter Notebook: Development environment

Conclusion
The implementation successfully demonstrated various data preprocessing techniques essen-
tial in data mining. The project showed how to effectively:

• Transform continuous data into meaningful categorical bins
• Standardize numerical data for better comparability
• Handle categorical variables through different encoding methods
• Deal with missing values using appropriate imputation techniques
• Visualize data distributions and relationships
These implementations provide a strong foundation for more advanced data mining tasks
and machine learning applications.
